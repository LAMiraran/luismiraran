							and formed small communities known as “Barangays”; These barangays were led by a Datu. These barangays were 
							linked to each other by kinship or in relation with other communities that formed allegiances. Since communities

							paving the way for power and conversion of religion. The Spanish colony contributed to the progress of the Religion, 
							Education, and Culture of Filipinos. However, the colonizers abused their power such as the ruling of the Encomienda 
							System which led to excessive taxation, slavery, and exploitation of resources and land of the locals. Occurrences of 
							inequality in education, opportunities, and even religion hindered Filipinos. Despite that, in the 1870s the emergence 
							of Ilustrados, or “enlightened ones” began the Propaganda Movement that fought for equality and freedom of Filipinos. 
							A notable figure in this movement is Jose Rizal who ignited the Filipinos to initiate the Philippine Revolution. </p>

							<p> After the Spanish Colony yielded (end of the Spanish-American War), rather than giving the Philippines its independence,
							it ended up in a Philippine-American War due to the Treaty of Paris that states that the Philippines is now claimed by 
							America. The motivations of the Americans were to have commercial opportunities in Asia. They thought of Filipinos as 
							having inadequate skills to self-govern and feared that another power (Germany or Japan) might take control of the 
							Philippines. So, the Americans launched a pacification, benevolent assimilation, that aims to gain the trust of the 
							Filipinos by giving them self-governance, social reforms, and education rights. In 1946, the U.S. granted the Philippines 
							its independence. </p>
